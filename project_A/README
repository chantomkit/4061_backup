The program first prompts the user to input:

1. The x, y, z dimensions of the crystal (periods of each direction)
2. The lattice constant

Upon inputting the informations, the crystals of simple cubic, bcc, fcc, diamond strcutures will be generated in .xyz format

I have written several modular functions, such that the modules can be reused for future tasks

1. Functions for generating coords of atoms (in 2D array) in simple cubic, bcc, fcc or diamond structure
2. Function for writing .xyz files given a 2D array storing each atom's coords in each row

hi some changes
