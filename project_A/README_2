This program does not prompt for user input. It run all test cases upon running and output in the stdout. \

Users may try editing the main() function to implement and use different test cases.\

1. Test for the reciprocal function, given real lattice vectors of SC, BCC, FCC and diamond as four test cases input.\

2. Test for the true distance function, given a real space distance vector and real unit cell vectors as input.\

3. Test for the neighbour list function, given a list of atomic position of SC crystal (function from project A part 1) and real unit cell vectors as input. Output of neighbour list is stored in a csv file for checking.
