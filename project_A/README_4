All codes are included in lab4.ipynb. Please use google colab to open it if necessary.

All modular functions in the notebook have descriptions explaining different purpose.

This file include xyz files for initial perturbed cell and final relaxed cell

Energy plots at each step is in the notebook.

1. LJ-potential and Gradient Descent for relaxing perturbed Argon Argon cell (FCC)
2. Coulomb Buckingham Potential and Conjugate Gradient Descent for relaxing perturbed MgO cell (FCC)

Part 1 works most of the time, the gradient and slopes are well-behaved and energy converges. In rare case it does not work, please rerun that block.

Part 2 does not work at all, the initial gradient for some atoms are very large already. The energy blows up after few steps. I will try fix it if I can do corrections afterwards.

I believe the energy blowing up is due to very close neighbours or numerical unstability of secant method near the root.
