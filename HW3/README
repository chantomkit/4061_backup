Question 1:

In original world, longest distance is by aiming at 42.5 degree because air resistance is higher

In parallel world, longest distance is by aiming at 45.5 degree because air resistance is lower

Question 2:

I tried to test p values from 0.5 to 1.5 with interval 0.1, they all converged at iteration 1 because they are already below del=1e-3 so the loop is terminated.

I don't think I have any code problems because I fully copy the one in lecture notes.

Still, I plot the curvature of all p values to see whats the difference, see q2.png
