The sessions in the notebook gives descriptions of all modular functions for different purpose.

There are xyz files for initial perturbed cell and final relaxed cell

Energy plot at each step is in the notebook.

1. LJ-potential and Gradient Descent for relaxing perturbed Argon Argon cell (FCC)
2. Coulomb Buckingham Potential and Conjugate Gradient Descent for relaxing perturbed MgO cell (FCC)

Part 1 works most of the time, the gradient and slopes are well-behaved and energy converges

Part 2 does not work at all, the initial gradient for some atoms are very large already. The energy blows up after few steps. I will try fix it if I can do corrections afterwards.
