Question 1:

In original world, longest distance is by aiming at 42.5 degree because air resistance is higher

In parallel world, longest distance is by aiming at 45.5 degree because air resistance is lower

Question 2:

I tried to test p values from 0.5 to 1.5 with interval 0.1, they all converged at iteration 1 because du is already below del=1e-3 so the loop is terminated.

Also, I plot the curvature of all p values in q2.png, no big difference...

I don't think I have any code problems because I fully copy the one in lecture notes.

All relaxation results can be found in csv files.
