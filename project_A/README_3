To compile: g++ -std=c++11 project_a_3.cpp -o project_a_3.exe

All the params for LJ potential and Coulomb Buckingham potential values are set as constant, their references can be found at the comment of the cpp source file.

The LJ and Coulomb Buckingham potential functions definition should have clear enough variable names for understanding

This program does not prompt for user input. It run all test cases upon running and output in the stdout.

Users may try editing the main() function to implement and use different test cases.

In the main function,

1. The loop for n_cells determine how many unti cells constitute the structure, e.g. n_cells = 8 means a 8x8 cell
2. The 4th argument of neighbour list function is the cutoff distance, I have set it to very large ~ 10 * lattice constant
3. After the loop, the function simply outputs the computed total energy of the structure, and the computed energy per atom with its reference value
